App Name: DGMS
This project aims to create an app for an existing government website. 
The goal is to improve accessibility and user experience.

  Initial step for designing this was a thorough research to understand user 
  needs and analyzing the existing government website. Then planned the layout 
  and structure, followed by interactive prototypes to test functionality and 
  user flow. Finally, designed the app and established a user-friendly interface, 
  selected appropriate color schemes, typography, and iconography, and ensured 
  compliance with government branding guidelines.
